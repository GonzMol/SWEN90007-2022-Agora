Daniel Blain            (DB)

---MINUTES---
DB: our lost marks for class diagram?
LR: needed to be a system-wide class diagram (including controllers and mappers, not just the domain)
MW: difference between setup and predconditions?
LR: setup would be initialising objects etc., preconditions is what's true at the time of the test
MW: we brainstormed concurrency issues initially
LR: yeah, one way to do it is to find concurrency issues by use case
LR: for testing, come up with a strategy; e.g. try to use boundary tests like in SST
CB: is it bad practice to use one UoW to handle multiple different transactions with different use cases
LR: that's ordinary - not sure how you'd change handling commits between different UoWs anyway
CB: there's a bit more logic in our deletion use cases, which we want to always go through
LR: in terms of upkeep, I'd say keep as one object, even if it requires more logic to get working
CB: is it okay to create database connections in the controllers, for some transactions?
LR: I think it's fine so long as you still have the DB class; though couldn't you just include it with Unit of Work
CB: we have it with the unit of work; it's more if there's a transaction that doesn't use Unit of Work
GM: we have a use case for what happens when two bids occur simultaneously
CB: we want to fetch the listing, lock it, check if the bid is higher, update and commit
LR: I think that can go into unit of work
CB: we need to read outside the unit of work (with locking)
LR: then just make a mapper function to place a bid
DB: a lot of our transaction logic is in the controllers
LR: then keep in the controllers
CB: you've given us feedback that our co-seller mapper isn't needed
LR: co-sellers aren't accessed outside of the context of a listing (always fetched with the listing)
CB: so then the listing mapper can update the co-seller table directly?
LR: yeah, that's fine
CB: Maria said we are expected to identify about 5 concurrency issues; we've found about fifteen
LR: that's better - 5 would be a minimum
LR: tip - if you can handle concurrency with the database itself then do so, and mention in the report
