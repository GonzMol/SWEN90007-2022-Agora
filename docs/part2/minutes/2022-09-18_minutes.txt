---MINUTES---
DB: I think it would be better if search filtering was done by the mapper
CB: we have the choice of filtering in the mapper or in the controller
DB: it's probably more efficient to filter in the query, though I have filtering in the controller
CB: might not be worth the effort, given how few users and listings we'll realistically have
CB: lazy loading and unit of work are just about done, UoW can cover order creation
MW: I'll work through getting the pages done
GM: the mappers should be just about done too
DB: it might be helpful if we can filter by active users, like by adding a boolean parameter to some mapper functions
GM: sure, can do
MW: do we need to do another domain model diagram for the report? I think it mentions it
DB: we also need to update our use cases for the checklist
