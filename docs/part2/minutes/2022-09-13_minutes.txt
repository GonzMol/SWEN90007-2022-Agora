---MINUTES---
DB: does anyone know how to generalise database access for different environments, e.g. via system variables?
GM: don't know, sorry
DB: I can try asking Luke tomorrow
GM: I'll try to have the mappers done by tonight
DB: have we decided how we're managing session?
CB: if we are using Spring security, does that require a session state?
MW: server side or client side?
CB: I think server side, not sure; we'd go with that if given the option
DB: so the user will have an access token then?
CB: I think so
CB: something as well, we might need the caller to submit objects to the UoW, rather than the objects doing it themselves
CB: the mapper doesn't need to know abstract classes; it can create objects of concrete classes by checking the data
CB: there are two constructors per class, one for creating and one for loading
GM: yes, the fetch functions use the latter
DB: do we want to fetch certain numbers of objects?
CB: I think we ignore pagination for now, it would add too much complexity
